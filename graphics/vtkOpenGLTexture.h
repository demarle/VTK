// .NAME vtkOpenGLTexture - OpenGL texture map
// .SECTION Description
// vtkOpenGLTexture is a concrete implementation of the abstract class 
// vtkTexture. vtkOpenGLTexture interfaces to the OpenGL rendering library.

  // Description:
  // Implement base class method.

  // Description:
  // Release any graphics resources that are being consumed by this texture.
  // The parameter window could be used to determine which graphic
  // resources to release. Using the same texture object in multiple
  // render windows is NOT currently supported.
